# VueNode-Chat

This application is based on a [project of mine made with Vuejs](https://github.com/Franklonchas/VueNotes), this project is a sticky notes live, with a chat for all the people that are connected to the application.

You can add, delete or modify your ideas and notes with others, so that others can also do the same with you at the same time. All the notes have their author and will post notices when something happens.

The chat is for all the members, in which there will be not only a conversation but a list of the users connected so far, it will be updated instantly if any user enters or leaves. The chat is enabled as long as you enter the application by registering with a nickname.

* In the future it will have enabled a file upload for the notes and for the users!
